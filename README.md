# Machine-Learning-Linear-Regression-in-single-variable-with-python

#Non Vectorized implementation file:
-Files Imported --
We will import numpy (for matrix multiplication and other mathematical operations), pandas (to read the datasets) , matplotlib.pyplot (to help plot the graphs of the outputs)
-Dataset --
Data1.txt file contains the dataset for linear regression with one variable. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.
-Implementation --
The gardient descent algorithm is used to predict the output that involves partial differentiation of cost function multiplied with the learning rate and then subtracted from the hypothetical parameters theta to eventually fit the given dataset.
